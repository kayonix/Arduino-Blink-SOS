# Arduino-Blink-SOS
Make your Arduino blink "SOS" in Morse code.
This simple program is perfect for beginners, yet serious enough to save a life!  
You only need the sketch code to drive the internal LED.
No wires, components or breadboards are necessary, except your choice of power cable.
If you have a portable 9-volt with the barrel connector for Arduino, you now have a complete SOS emergency kit!
Maybe put it in a clear box or bag to keep it dry on your adventures.
It doesn't get easier than that!
